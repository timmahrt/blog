# Taiwan Huandao 2024

## Day 1 Before departure

This was the roughest day for me.
I got the cheapest flight which arrived at 2am in Taipei.
Hotels near the airport were either fully booked or expensive and the train wasn't running.

Fortunately there is a bus that goes to the main train station but the line was so long, I had to wait for three buses before I could board--everyone else flying in was in the same situation as me.
After arriving in downtown Taipei, I planned to sleep for a bit at a netcafe. 
Unfortunately, it was fully booked.
It being about 5am at this point and without a plan B, I to just start my day.

When I left Japan, I had two things I needed to get before picking up my rental bicycle:
- a travel sim card for my phone
- some cycling clothes

### Getting a SIM card

The recommendations I read online said to buy my sim card at the airport.
However, I had flown into Taipei too early, when all the stores were closed.
I could have waited to go to a mobile store when it opened but I had time so I walked to Songshan Airport.
It took about 5 minutes and ~$20 to get a sim card with 2 weeks of unlimited data.

As I was leaving the airport, someone cheerily waved to me.
Taiwanese people are quite warm and friendly I thought.

#### Retrospective

I had no problems the entire time with my mobile connection while I was in Taiwan, so I think that worked out well.
I stopped by a different branch of the same store when I was flying out of Taoyuan and they helped me pop in my original sim card.

### Cycling clothes

Before leaving Japan I tried to buy some cycling clothes but the two stores I visited had already replaced their summer clothes with winter ones.
I bought some shorts with built-in chamois and planned to get the rest in Taipei.
I had read that the sports chain Decathalon had cycling wear and originally planned to go there.
However, I found by chance online a local store called <a href="https://www.montt.cc/en/">Montt</a>.
They have Taiwan-inspired prints, so I thought it would be cool to at least pick up a jersey or something.

Their store is located in the Zhongshan District, not far from Songshan Airport--so I continued my walk.

I arrived a bit early and had breakfast at a restaurant that specialized in peanut butter sandwiches.

Montt is located inside a university, in a sort of incubator section.
I arrived right when they opened

I actually didn't know anything about cycling gear which was part of the reason I came with nothing.
Fortunately, Alan, who was working that day spoke good English.
We talked for the better part of an hour about cycling clothes while I tried on various things.
I was unsure whether I should get shorts or a bib.
Alan suggested that shorts would probably be fine for me--bibs are more useful for keeping the shorts and chamois in place particularly when doing lots of hills.
However, I liked the sort of snug, stable fit of the bib, so I went with a bib, a jersey, and some compression socks.

#### Retrospective 

I hadn't budgeted buying a full cycling outfit and wondered whether or not I should.
In retrospect, buying the bib was the correct choice.
The chamois fit better and might be a bit thicker than the chamois in the shorts I brought with me.
I didn't feel as sore on the days I was wearing it.

In the end, I had two sets of cycling wear--two bottoms with chamois and then one cycling jersey and one fast-drying shirt I use for cycling.
I think the cycling jersey was a bit superfluous for my purposes.
If you're doing high-speed cycling it might be useful but for a long, casual ride I'm not sure it offers much benefit.
That said, I don't regret buying the jersey.
If anything it makes me look and feel a bit more like a "real" cyclist.
I'll be wearing it when I go on cycling rides now for sure.
And if I'm back in Taipei sometime (next year?) I think I might buy another design!

### Rental bicycle

#### Before visting Taiwan

Before flying to Taiwan I searched online for a rental bicycle.
<a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/tw">Giant Bicycles</a> has stores around the country.
However, it seems that they might be difficult to rent from if you don't live in Taiwan.
<a href="https://mathewbike.com/">Mathew Bike</a> seems to be a well known brand that supports tourists from abroad.
I emailed them but actually they had no units available.
Next, just a few days before departure, I contacted <a href="https://taipeibikeworks.com/en">Taipei Bike Works</a> and was fortunate that they had bicycles available.
If they hadn't, I probably would have done the Huandao via train and bus.
^^"

#### Day 1 in Taiwan

After finishing my cycling clothes shopping, I met up with a friend for lunch and then we went together to Taipei Bike Works, where I picked up my rental bicycle.

When I arrived, they were preparing my bicycle.
Fortunately the staff member who helped me (unfortunately, I forgot her name!) spoke perfect English and I was able to ask many questions about cycling.

Included in my rental was a light, helmet, cup holder, spare tire, and universal tool.
I paid a bit more to get a panier with two bags for my luggage and a cell phone holder.

After tuning up the bike, I was off!
My friend and I rode together following the river for about 30 minutes or so, into New Taipei.
But at a certain point, our paths diverged and I set off on the Huandao alone.

#### Retrospective

I requested their Merida Explorer.
It's the cheapest rental bicycle they have.
I debated between that or their next cheapest option but decided I probably didn't need it.
In hindsight, it was the correct choice.
I was traveling pretty casually.
A more serious cyclist may want to consider a more professional bicycle.

Paying for the panier bags to store my luggage and the cell phone holder was a no-brainer.

When I returned the bicycle they were surprised to hear that I didn't encounter any bicycle incidents or equipment failures while I was on the road.
I feel very fortunate to have had such a smooth trip.

Since my trip, many people ask if I considered bringing my own bicycle.
I didn't give it much thought.
I rode on an LCC airline.
I assumed it would be more cost efficient to get a rental bike locally but I will look into it for my next trip!
