#### Retrospective

I think it was the perfect setup for my trip.
I alternated between my two cycling outfits.
In the evening, I changed into my day clothes and washed my cycling outfit, letting it dry overnight.
Most of my hotels had a washing machine and a rooftop area where clothes could hang to dry.
In cases where they didn't, I washed my clothes in the sink.
I was worried that by the end of my trip my clothes would be pretty gross, but actually it was fine.

The compression socks came in a zipbag which I reused as a coin bag.
Similarly, I stored my wallet, receipts, and password in the zip bag that my cycling bib came in.
It might have been better if I had prepared my own bags.

I should have downloaded a book or something on my phone.
I had zero downtime during my trip but especially on my way back home, I had nothing to occupy myself.
