# Taiwan Huandao 2024

In October 2024, I spent 9 days doing a cycling trip around Taiwan, on a route known as the Huandao (Route 1).
I'm documenting my travels here in case it is useful to anyone out there.

## Before leaving

### Deciding to do the Huandao

At the beginning of October 2024, I decided to take a trip.
I had two weeks of holidays to use by the end of October, or they would be lost.
I didn't have a lot of time to plan the trip, so I was looking for some sort of adventure that I could map out as I go.
A colleague suggested a cycling trip in Korea--on a route called the Four Rivers.
It sounded amazing, but wouldn't use even half of my holidays.
It's rare that I get such a long holiday and I wanted to do something that would require the full length of time.
But that got me thinking.
What about other, long distance cycling routes?

Online, I discovered the Taiwan Huandao and it seemed like a perfect fit.
- the route is said to take 9-13 days.
- October is perhaps one of the best months to do it because the weather is mild and taiphoons are infreqent.
- descriptions online mentioned an abundance of bike maintence stations, bike lanes, and the ability to bring onto the train--it seemed like there would be a great support system.

### Preparation

I booked my flight Saturday night for a flight the following Thursday evening.
But I was bothered by a lingering thought.
Was I fit enough to cycle 100km+ every day for 9 days?
Was I even fit enough to cycle 100km in 1 day?
I decided to try it.
I've cycling quite a bit casually and even done longish day trips, but nothing like this.
So the next day, I woke up early to cycle the coast of Kanagawa prefecture in Japan.
This is a part of the Pacific Cycling Road, a route that is 1,487km long stretching from Chiba prefecture to Wakayama.
Of that length, the coast of Kanagawa is about 110km.

The app I used logged 113km in 6.5 hours, going from Yokosuka to Yugawara.
I had a leisurly dinner and two hot spring visits and ended up missing the last train home.
Instead I took the last train to Machida and had to cycle another 2 hours (+31km) for a total of 145km in 8.5 hours.
That wasn't my plan but the next day, I felt pretty good and I considered the trial a success.

Was I fit enough to cycle 100km+ every day for 9 days?
Maybe not, but I felt that I could at least do a few days.
It was all part of the adventure.

I tried to read up as much as possible before leaving but 

## Cycling the Huandao

The Huandao follows Route 1 around Taiwan, starting and stopping in Taipei.

* On Day 1 I didn't start recording my route until around when I was leaving Taipei. My actual riding time was probably another hour long or so.
* On Day 2 I took an official detour which followed the coast.
* On Day 8 I followed the official recommendation to take the train from Xincheng to Su'ao.
The actual distance between Ruisui and Jiaoxi is about 200km.
